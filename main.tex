\chapter{Acknowledgment}
I would like to thank everybody who helped and supported me throughout the long
journey I had to finish this thesis. First and foremost, I am grateful of the
support I received from my supervisors Prof. Dr. Nico Pfeifer and Prof. Dr. Dr.
Thomas Lengauer at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbr\"ucken,
Germany, and Dr. Ryan Brinkman at the Terry Fox Labs in the British Columbia
Cancer Research Center in Vancouver, Canada. I also would like to thank Dr. MD.
Andrew Weng in the same lab.

I am also extremely thankful of my partner Aleksandra Piwowarek and my parents
who have been very supportive and encouraging during the hard times and never
gave up on being encouraging. I would not have finished this thesis without
their continuous support.

I would like to extend this acknowledgment to my colleagues with whom I have
worked and collaborated, and who have supported me with all the brainstorming
and discussions we have had. The list is long, but I would like to mention
Sarvesh Nikumbh, Nora Speicher, Anna Feldmann, Nima Aghaeepour, and Kieren
O'Neil.

The last, but not least, is to acknowledge the support I have received from my
friends from all around the world. I would like to mention Marjan Farahbod,
Iran Mansoori, Matti Lyra, Hassan Hatefi, Faraz Makari, Rob McGee, and Cyrus
Altschuck.

\begin{abstract}
Cancer is a hard problem. It is hard for the patients, for the doctors and
nurses, and for the researchers working on understanding the disease and
finding better treatments for it. The challenges faced by a pathologist
diagnosing the disease for a patient is not necessarily the same as the ones
faced by cell biologists working on experimental treatments and understanding
the fundamentals of cancer. In this thesis we work on different challenges
faced by both of the above teams.

This thesis first presents methods to improve the analysis of the flow
cytometry data used frequently in the diagnosis process, specifically for the
two subtypes of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma which are our focus: Follicular Lymphoma
and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma. With a combination of concepts from graph
theory, dynamic programming, and machine learning, we present methods to
improve the diagnosis process and the analysis of the abovementioned data. The
interpretability of the method helps a pathologist to better understand a
patient's disease, which itself improves their choices for a treatment.

In the second part, we focus on the analysis of DNA-methylation and gene
expression data, both of which presenting the challenge of being very high
dimensional yet with a few number of samples comparatively. We present an
ensemble model which adapts to different patterns seen in each given data, in
order to adapt to noise and batch effects. At the same time, the
interpretability of our model helps a pathologist to better find and tune the
treatment for the patient: a step further towards personalized medicine.
